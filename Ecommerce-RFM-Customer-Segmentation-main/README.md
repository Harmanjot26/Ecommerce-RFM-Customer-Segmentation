## Overview
Olist just started an e-commerce startup based in Portugal that recently opened an online website to sell their product. Fortunately, Olist is launching their website when the covid-19 hits and making them grow faster than ever. However, Olist is still not using targeted marketing which hurts their marketing budget as only a fraction of their user comes back to their website.

## Objective
Help Olist to increase their marketing conversion rate by doing targeted marketing using customer segmentation so that it will not hurt their budget.

## Analysis
Customer segmentation is one of the most important marketing tools, because it can help a business to better understand its target audience. Segmenting customer helps in better understanding the customers and thus personalizing marketing and communication for each segment.

We will segment our customer using RFM analysis
- **Recency (R)** : Difference between days since last purchase and observed days.
- **Frequency (F)** : How many of transcaction each customer made?
- **Monetary (M)** : How much each customer spend ?
